In the futuristic metropolis of Algorithmia, the Code-Cure Clinic stands as a beacon of order and health.
 Every day, new patients (known as 'Patient-Objects') arrive seeking care, each with a unique ID and data-illness. 
The heart of our clinic is the "Doubly-Linked Ward," an endless chain of Bed nodes, where every bed knows what's 
next to it and what was prev. This special ward is managed by Matron Linked-List, who can glide forward and backward 
down the line to check on anyone. When a new patient is admitted, she finds an empty Bed node and uses the assignPatient
 function to link them in. To find a specific patient, we deploy "Search-Specialist Hadia" who uses her HashMap-like 
brain to searchByPatientName instantly. If we only have a room number, "Array-Ranger Ahmed" can searchByBedNumber to find its 
status. When a patient is healthy, we call the dischargePatient function, which neatly unlinks them from the bed, making it
 available again. "Stack-Manager Sarim" handles all the paperwork, ensuring the last patient admitted is the first one he 
checks on for morning rounds. Together, our team of DS-Wizards ensures every patient is allocated, managed, and 
cured, with no data ever lost!
